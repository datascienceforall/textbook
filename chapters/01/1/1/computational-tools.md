Computational Tools
-------------------

This text uses the Python 3 programming language, along with a standard set of
numerical and data visualization tools that are used widely in commercial
applications, scientific experiments, and open-source projects.
Python has recruited enthusiasts from many professions that use data to draw
conclusions. By learning the Python language, you will join a
million-person-strong community of software developers and data scientists.
This text will teach you to write programs, generate images from data, and work with
real-world data sets that are published online.

**Getting Started (for students in Data Science For All).** 
You don't need to install any software on your computer.  Everything
will run in your web browser. Just log in to [Vocareum
Labs](https://labs.vocareum.com). After you are enrolled in the course,
you should have full access to the programming environment hosted on
that site. If not, contact the [course 
administrator](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1380/2018sp/staff.html) to
request access.  If you have any technical difficulties with
Vocareum, consult with your recitation TA for assistance. All
assignments (labs, homeworks, and projects) will be released to you in
Vocareum, and you will submit them there, too.  

**Getting Started (for others).**
A Python program can be executed by any computer, regardless of its
manufacturer or operating system, provided that support for the language is
installed. If you wish to install the version of Python and its accompanying
libraries that will match this text, we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  Make sure to install the 
Python 3 version, not the Python 2 version.  You'll also need to 
install the `datascience` [library](https://github.com/data-8/datascience).
The easiest way to do that is to open a terminal and run `pip install datascience`.
